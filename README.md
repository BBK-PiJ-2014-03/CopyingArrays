CopyingArrays
=============

Create a new Java class called ArrayCopier with a method called copy that takes two arrays of integers as param- eters. The method should copy the elements of the first array (yo u can call it src , from “source”) to the second one ( dst , from “destination”) as much as possible. If the second array is smaller, then only those elements that fit will b e copied. If the second array is larger, it will be filled with zeroes. Write a program that creates an object of this class and uses this m ethod to copy some arrays in all three cases: • Both arrays are of the same size. • The source array is longer. • The source array is shorter.
